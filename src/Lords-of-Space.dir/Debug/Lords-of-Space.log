    By not providing "Findsfml-graphics.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
    project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
    "sfml-graphics", but CMake did not find one.

    with any of the following names:
  
      sfml-graphicsConfig.cmake

    Add the installation prefix of "sfml-graphics" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
    "sfml-graphics_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
